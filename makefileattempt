Montfort, Nick and Ian Bogost. Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2009.


	Racing the Beam functions as a case study of the platform of the Atari Video Computer System that was launched in 1977. 
	This study focuses primarily on the beginnings of the home electronic game console, as well as what the authors consider 
	the six most influential games that were released on the platform. It ends with an analysis of the crash of the home electronic
	game market. The analysis is very technical throughout, examining the technical aspects of the cartridges and system, 
	including the various techniques, coding, and styles that were implemented to create these games. One interesting point
	that the authors demonstrate is that many of the early games were based on space shooters, war games, driving games, 
	and sports games. It also examines the implementation of high scores within games, which might explain some competitiveness
	of electronic games. They also discuss the importance of discovery and experimentation in figuring out the mechanics
	of a game. One of the most important aspects for my work is the section regarding Mystiqueâ€™s pornographic games that
	were created for the Atari VCS, in which they discuss rape fantasy and masturbatory games.
